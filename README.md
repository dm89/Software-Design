# Software-Design

### assign 1 - Using Test First Development (no code without test first) implement the minesweeper game in Groovy.

### assign 2 - The openweathermap.org site provides weather data. We can access, for example,
the weather in Houston, by sending a request to

http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Houston,us&units=imperial

This program will read from a file a list of cities. It will then get the temperature and the current condition (for example, sunny or cloudy) from the webservice mentioned above. The program will then display, in sorted order of the city name, the current temperature and the weather condition. 
It will also report the hottest city and the coldest city.
